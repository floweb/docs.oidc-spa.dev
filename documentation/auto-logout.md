# ⏲️ Auto Logout

Enforcing that your user be automatically logged out after a set period of inactivity is a policy that is enforced on the identity server. &#x20;

For example, if you're using Keycloak and you want you want an auto disconnect after 10 minutes of inactivity you would set the SSO Session Idle to 10 minutes. See [Keycloak configuratio guide](../resources/usage-with-keycloak.md).
