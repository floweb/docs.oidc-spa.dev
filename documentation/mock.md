# ðŸŽ­ Mock

For some usecases you might want to mock the adapter, simulate a user autentication without any actual autentication server being involved.  \
This is usefull, if you are building an app in wich the user authentication is a feature but not a requirement.  \
It's also usefull to run tests or in Storybook. &#x20;
